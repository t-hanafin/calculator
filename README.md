Hello. This is my version of the Odin Project "Calculator" assignment. It 
will be a calculator.

This calculator replicates most of the functions of a simple pocket calculator
or the iOS calculator application. The operators and equals buttons have
different modes depending on what has been input or what calculations have been
performed.

For example, repeatedly pressing the equals button will repeat the last operation
with the last number entered and the current result. Meaning for example you can add
the number 3 to itself infinitely. I do not really see the use of this feature, but
most calculators do it.

It is also possible to perform a continuous series of calculations with a running
total by alternating entering numbers and operators.
