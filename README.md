Hello. This is my version of the Odin Project "Calculator" assignment. It 
will be a calculator.

Bugs I have noticed:

- this thing sometimes won't perform the proper operation when that operation
has been entered through a keyboard. Something about the event-handler
and how it passes arguments to the button-press function. Otherwise
it works well with button-input.
